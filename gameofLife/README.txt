Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by the mathematician John Conway. It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, with no further input from humans. The game consists of a grid of cells, each of which can be in one of two states: alive or dead.

The game evolves in discrete steps or generations. At each step, the following rules are applied to determine the state of each cell in the next generation:

    Overpopulation: If a living cell is surrounded by more than three living cells, it dies due to overpopulation.

    Underpopulation: If a living cell is surrounded by fewer than two living cells, it dies due to underpopulation.

    Survival: If a living cell is surrounded by two or three living cells, it survives to the next generation.

    Reproduction: If a dead cell is surrounded by exactly three living cells, it becomes alive in the next generation, as if by reproduction.

These rules create interesting and often unpredictable patterns. The Game of Life is known for its emergent complexity, where simple rules give rise to complex and intricate patterns.

Here's a simple summary of the rules:

    A living cell with 2 or 3 neighbors survives.
    A dead cell with exactly 3 neighbors becomes alive (reproduction).
    All other living cells die in the next generation due to underpopulation or overpopulation.
    All other dead cells remain dead.

The initial pattern, or "seed," of living and dead cells, is set by the user, and from there, the evolution of the system is determined solely by the rules described above. The Game of Life has applications in computer science, biology, and mathematics and has been studied extensively for its fascinating properties.
